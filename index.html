            The provided texts are metadata records from the Smithsonian's Freer Gallery 
            of Art and Arthur M. Sackler Gallery, describing three distinct but related 
            blue-and-white porcelain pieces from a five-piece garniture. Each record details
             the object's physical characteristics, provenance, and history of ownership,
              tracing their journey from the Duveen Brothers to the Freer Gallery. The objects,
               created in Jingdezhen, China during the Qing dynasty's Kangxi reign, are described 
               as including vases and beakers, with intricate cobalt blue underglaze decorations of court 
               scenes and floral motifs. The records also note the digital 3D models available of the 
               objects and specify usage rights.

                    <h3>Introduce</h3>
                 <p>This is a beaker-shaped vase, one of two in a five-piece garniture.
                     It is made of white porcelain with a clear, feldspathic glaze. 
                     The vase is decorated with underglaze cobalt blue painting depicting 
                     a court scene.It was created in Jingdezhen, Jiangxi province, China, 
                     during the Kangxi reign (1662-1722) of the Qing dynasty.</p>
                <p>A garniture is a set of decorative vases or other objects, typically 
                    made of porcelain or ceramic, intended to be displayed together.
                     This vase was part of a five-piece garniture, meaning it was originally 
                     displayed with four other matching pieces.
                     The vase is decorated in underglaze cobalt blue with a court scene similar 
                     to that found on the baluster vases in the same garniture. It also depicts 
                     court ladies in a garden setting. The different scenes are divided by herringbone 
                     borders.</p>

                    <h3>Introduce</h3>
                 <p>This object is a covered baluster vase, one of three in a five-piece garniture. 
                    It is made of white porcelain with a clear, feldspathic glaze. The vase is decorated 
                    with underglaze cobalt blue painting. The main scene depicts a court lady being entertained 
                    by a dancer and musicians. The neck of the vase is decorated with floral sprays, and the domed
                     cover features ladies, flowers, rocks, and a bud-shaped finial knob.
                     This vase dates back to the Kangxi reign (1662-1722) of the Qing dynasty in China. It is a
                      prime example of Jingdezhen ware, known for its high quality and beautiful blue-and-white decoration.
                       The vase's provenance includes prominent collectors such as Duveen Brothers, Mrs. B. F. Jones,
                        and Myron S. Falk, Sr.</p>
                <p>This vase was made in Jingdezhen, Jiangxi province, China, a renowned center for porcelain production 
                    since the Yuan dynasty.</p> 
                    <p>The assembled vase, including the cover, has a height of 45.5 cm (17 15/16 in) and a diameter of 
                        17.1 cm (6 3/4 in).A garniture is a set of decorative objects, typically vases, designed to be displayed 
                        together. This vase was part of a five-piece garniture, which likely included two other covered baluster 
                        vases and two beaker-shaped vases.</p>

                    <h3>Introduce</h3>
                 <p>The vase is made of porcelain with a cobalt blue pigment under a clear glaze.

                 </p>
                <p>This vase was made in Jingdezhen, Jiangxi province, China, a renowned center for porcelain production 
                    since the Yuan dynasty.The vase is 44.5 cm (17 1/2 in) high and has a diameter of 21.4 cm (8 7/16 in).</p> 
                    <p>The vase is crafted in the Jingdezhen ware style, a type of porcelain known for its high quality 
                        and intricate designs.</p>    
                        <p>The vase is decorated with a large, loose lotus scroll on each of its three sections.
                             A band filled with a diaper pattern encircles the central lobed section. The design 
                             was inspired by ancient bronze Ku vessels.</p>   
                        <p>
                            The vase was made in Jingdezhen, Jiangxi province, China, during the Kangxi 
                            period of the Qing dynasty. This dates the vase to the mid-17th to early 18th century.
